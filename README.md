Python API Exercise - What's the Weather Like?
<i>A two part assignment.</i>

## WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

### Requirements
Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following:
• Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
• Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
• Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
• Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Run linear regression on each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.
• Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
• Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
• Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
• Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Results

## VacationPy
Use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations.

### Requirements
• Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part 1
• Narrow down the dataframe to find your ideal weather condition.
• Use Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5,000 meters of your coordinates.
• plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City and Country
